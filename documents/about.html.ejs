title: About AkashaCMS - the powerful static file CMS to build your dream website

<p>AkashaCMS was developed by myself, <a href="http://davidherron.com">David Herron</a>, in 2012 after a long period of pondering the value of dynamic CMS's like Drupal.  I have years of Drupal use, programming, and configuration, and can do quite fancy things with Drupal.  However, over time I realized that the overhead of maintaining Drupal was keeping me from doing the writing I had set out to do.  Further, that I needed a publishing system that would let me focus on publishing content, freeing me from maintenance chores.</p>

<p>Most content management systems have a dynamic page generation system that even lets each page be completely customized to each viewer of the page.  One realization I had is that, for my sites, I saw little need for dynamic generation of each page on each page load.  This entails a lot more server load than simply having HTML pages on a disk.</p>

<p>At the same time it's very useful to have powerful customization capability for each page.  I simply realized there was little need to regenerate each page every time someone viewed the page.</p>

<p>Why not just balance the modern features of modern CMS's, of modern JavaScript UI frameworks, with the efficiency of static HTML pages on a disk?</p>

<p>That's what AkashaCMS does.  It gives you a flexible page generation system, and lots of support for the newest HTML5 and semantic web goodness.  You can easily add OpenGraph tags to the header, for example, and any JavaScript or CSS file is easily pulled in.</p>

<p><b>Purpose</b>: Seek a return to straight HTML files, while retaining the flexibility of modern CMS's and modern advanced JavaScript/CSS UI frameworks.  </p>

<p><b>Scope</b>: This is a system for producing a website full of HTML files.  The input content files can reference external data sources, just as dynamic CMS's do, etc.</p>

<p><b>Maintainership</b>: At this time this is the work of myself, David Herron.  If you have ideas, fork the <a href="https://github.com/robogeek/akashacms">AkashaCMS github project</a> then send a pull request.  Over time there might need to be an expansion into a more formal arrangement, but at the moment this will do.</p>
