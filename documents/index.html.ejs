<p align="center"><em>Akasha means the basis and essence of all things in the material world; the first material element created from the astral world. </em></p>

<p align="center"><em>AkashaCMS (<a href="https://github.com/robogeek/akashacms">github project</a>) is a Node.js based tool with which you can convert ideas into websites while maintaining separation between content, layout and design.</em></p>

<p>With AkashaCMS, one writes web content in HTML (or Markdown) but with none of the styling and framing boilerplate that surrounds the content.  Styles, page layouts, and navigational elements are kept in separate files, and are brought together in a highly flexible manner to produce HTML files.  We use the HTML5 boilerplate project to provide a modern foundation.  Several templating engines are available to facilitate bringing in data from external repositories. </p>

<p>The goal for AkashaCMS is to provide most of the flexibility of a full scale CMS, incorporate modern JavaScript/CSS UI frameworks, while producing static HTML files, and skipping the administrative overhead of running a full CMS.</p>

<p>Technology: Node.js - Markdown - EJS templates - LESS - jQuery - Bootstrap - Server-side jQuery - OEmbed</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/robogeek/akashacms-example">AkashaCMS Example github project</a> contains a small working example of an AkashaCMS site.  The rendered version of that example is at <a href="http://example.akashacms.com">example.akashacms.com</a>.  The <a href="https://github.com/robogeek/akashacms-website">source code for this website</a> serves as a larger example of AkashaCMS use. </p>
