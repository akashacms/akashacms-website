The `akashacms-booknav` doesn't quite live up to the original goal, but it is still useful.  The goal had been to support a tree of documents, with "Next" and "Previous" links between documents to make a group of pages that act somewhat like chapters in a book.  The idea was inspired by the `book` module in Drupal.

The part of `akashacms-booknav` which works correctly generates an indented listing of all the child documents to the current document.

The list of links in the [AkashaCMS plugin directory](index.html) is generated with this module.
