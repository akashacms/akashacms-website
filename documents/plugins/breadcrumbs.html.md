The breadcrumb trail at the top of each page on this site is generated by `akashacms-breadcrumbs`.  On this site the code generating the breadcrumb exists in several layout templates such as [default.html.ejs](https://github.com/robogeek/akashacms-website/blob/master/layouts/default.html.ejs).

    <section id="breadcrumb" class="col-sm-12">
    <breadcrumb-trail/>
    </section>

The code uses the `breadcrumbTrail` function, internal to the plugin, to search upward from the current document.  It locates each page named `index.html` and extracts its title, generating a link to each one.
