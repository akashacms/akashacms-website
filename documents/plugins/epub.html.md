teaser: An EPUB 3 file is just a zip file, with HTML files for content, and XML files for metadata.  AkashaCMS is surprisingly easy to adapt to producing EPUB files.

AkashaEPUB leverages AkashaCMS's ability to render content, to provide tools for building EPUB 3 documents.

I don't have time to fully document this.  See https://github.com/akashacms/epub-guide for a start at an EPUB book which describes how to build EPUB books using AkashaEPUB.  That git repository is a working example which shows what to do.
