title: Check generated HTML for correctness (akashacms-htmlcheck)

---

This plugin has not been written yet.  The idea is to verify that HTML generated for a website is correct.

Note that AkashaCMS doesn't know anything about HTML.  It simply uses some template rendering engines to render content into templates.

Whether the HTML that's generated is correct is dependent on the templates.

Implementation of this module is blocked because of an architectural problem in AkashaCMS.
