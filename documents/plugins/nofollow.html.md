This plugin has not been written yet.  The idea is to add `rel=nofollow` attributes to links based on their destination.

Links to some sites will get marked with the `nofollow` attribute.  This is important in certain cases, for example it's recommended for SEO purposes (by Google) to use `rel=nofollow` on links to products you are selling via an affiliate program.

Implementation of this module is blocked because of an architectural problem in AkashaCMS.
