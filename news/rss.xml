Both talk about static assets for website, but what does that really mean?  To help decode the vague marketing words, let's examine the technologies, see how they differ, and try to figure out if there's anything important to learn.

The EJS template engine is competent, but there are many other engines with huge capabilities that could potentially be useful in AkashaCMS.  I have two thoughts in mind, to bring in more powerful template engines, but to also find which template engine has the best performance.  In other words, it's possible to improve AkashaCMS performance by adopting a different template engine.

The tools for AkashaCMS let us edit Markdown files in a programmers editor, like Visual Studio Code, but then we're left to our imagination as to how the page will look.  It's easy to set up a preview mode in an AkashaCMS project using a simple command-line HTML server and an external web browser.  But it's not well integrated with the editing experience, and in practice I never did it.  There is a Visual Studio Code extension that makes this better offering a good preview experience right inside VSCode.

AkashaCMS is a reflection of my concern over the energy and resource consumption involved in regular dynamic CMS's like Wordpress or Drupal.  Getting good performance on a dynamic CMS requires a virtual private server (VPS), adding to the cost and resource consumption.  We should all be worried over the climate change and environmental impacts of our choices, including how we host our websites.

Search engines take a dim view of outbound links where there is a monetary gain -- e.g. an affiliate link -- that lack the <em>rel=nofollow</em> attribute.  Automatically setting appropriate affiliate referral codes on all relevant external links is important for fully monetizing external links.  In this article we'll go over a new package that handles both those tasks.  It has an easy-to-use API where HTML enters the processor, and processed HTML is given as a result.  The methodology can be expanded to handle approximately a zillion other HTML DOM processing tasks.

I also tangentially talked about the lack of other tools with similar capabilities.  It seems from my incomplete survey of the market that software to create EPUB's or static HTML websites usually require either an installed server-side rendering system, or else a heavy-weight WYSIWYG desktop-publishing application.  </p>

<p>What the AkashaRender, AkashaCMS, AkashaEPUB system offers is lightweight tools that run on your laptop yet produce websites or EPUB's built using the latest web techniques. </p>

<p>Let's talk about that for a bit.</p>
]]></description><link>https://akashacms.com/news/2017/08/build-epubs-on-laptop.html</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://akashacms.com/news/2017/08/build-epubs-on-laptop.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Published 2nd edition Creating eBooks with Markdown and Open Source Tools]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In June and July, I set about updating the AkashaCMS toolchain to be based on AkashaRender.  The AkashaEPUB toolchain also had to change, and that necessitated a new edition of <em>Creating eBooks with Markdown and Open Source Tools</em>.  This book is the official guide for using AkashaCMS/AkashaEPUB tools to build electronic books.  The major feature addition, despite it being much easier to configure AkashaRender to produce EPUB's, is that you can now publish to both EPUB and Website from the same content. </p>

<p>I haven't found another system to do that - to publish exactly the same content as either EPUB or a Website.  Okay, that's not quite right since Gitbook can publish to EPUB, MOBI, PDF or online.  However, Gitbook limits you to using their servers which just doesn't make sense.  Rendering EPUB's and Websites is a lightweight lightweight enough to run on your laptop.  Why use a SaaS eBook-publishing system that ensnare's you into using their server?  With AkashaEPUB, you get a light-weight system that can run on any computer, and publish EPUB's or websites.</p>

It may seem utterly simple when you paste a URL into a Facebook or Twitter status message, or a Wordpress blog post, and voila the embedded HTML snippet automatically pops up.  Under the covers certain kinds of magic is done with oEmbed and OpenGraph protocols.  A couple years ago when I started the <em>akashacms-embeddables</em> plugin that stuff either was immature, or I didn't understand it, or didn't know about it, or something, but the initial versions of the plugin didn't take advantage of those protocols, and instead had lots of special casing and hard-coded understanding of how to construct a Twitter <em>iframe</em>.</p>

<p>Now that the new AkashaRender-based system is published, I wanted to take the opportunity to clean up the <em>akashacms-embeddables</em> plugin.  I've found a pair of packages that make retrieving oEmbed and OpenGraph data very nice and easy.</p>

It was a powerful system, with it I built several large websites, wrote a book, and so forth.  But its inner structure had grown organically into a bit of a mess.  My pondering about what to do led me to implement a complete rewrite.  The new rendering engine, AkashaRender, is more flexible and is more sensibly organized.  It is also incompatible with the older system.</p>

<p>Over the last week I have deprecated the old <em>akashacms</em>-based system, and have published updates to everything including the plugins and this website.  This blog post goes over what's happened.</p>

Both of the changes are major, and take AkashaCMS to a new level of flexibility. First, Website authors will be able to use any combination of template engine on each page, giving better flexibility over page formatting. Second, the capability to use server-side jQuery calls means a different approach to inserting content into the page (versus traditional templates) plus we can implement filters to make broad-based content tweaks.

Usually we're forced to download the file to our local computer, then view it using a separate viewer.  It litters the Downloads directory with old files we've downloaded, and it's somewhat jarring to find yourself suddenly having to navigate to a separate viewer application.  Further, an external viewer probably doesn't work well on a mobile device where the operating paradigm is quite different from desktop computers.

What, then, is the role of old-school HTML websites?  In particular, why am I wasting my time building AkashaCMS and not building websites with Drupal?

This version has been over a year in development and isn't quite what I'd intended, but it is a result of the actual needs during the past year.  The primary change was to architect AkashaCMS to support plugins, a move which allowed the creation of several useful plugins.

<p>Okay, that was pretty dense so let's take it one step at a time.</p>
